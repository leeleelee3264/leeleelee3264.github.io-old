## Dockerfile command cheat sheet
I have to make image before running docker container with the image. How to get images I need?
I can just pull images from my/someone else's docker hub repository or I can even make one all by myself.
Do this, I must write Dockerfile. Dockerfile is just like a recipe for building images.

## docker command cheat sheet
Docker is working like linux. It's tiny which contains minimum setting to run server I can tell.
I have to type docker dedicated command to manipulate docker container.
